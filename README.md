# Oil_Splitting_Analysis
This is an analytical oil splitting machine that combine between Python and Microsoft Excel to split produced oil from multilayer reservoir.

The case of this splitting take place at "X" Field which has around 1900 wells, with about 600,000 production data and 200,000 completion event data.

Here it is the result of splitting process!

First, we have to prepare the data such as:

- Production data
- Completion data
- Marker data

Then we have to mark by the the thickness of perforated zone:

After we have the mark then we continue to split the oil and water prdction like this:
